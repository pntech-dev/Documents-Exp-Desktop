## 🏗 Architecture

The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.

```
┌──────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌───────┐
│ View │ <-- │ Controller │ --> │ Model │
└──────┘     └────────────┘     └───────┘
  UI           Logic            Data/API
```

- **View:** Handles UI rendering and user events (PyQt5).
- **Controller:** Orchestrates logic, handles signals, and communicates between View and Model.
- **Model:** Manages data, API communication, and business logic.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.14
- **GUI Framework:** PyQt5
- **API Communication:** Requests (with Session handling)
- **Security:** Keyring (for token storage)
- **Templating:** Jinja2 (for dynamic QSS generation)
- **Document Handling:** python-docx
